#### I'm Jyotsna (say:johts-nah), a Computer Science masters student at UChicago, with a specialization in ML and data analytics.

I am currently working as a researcher with the Kasthuri Lab, and my area of focus is Machine Learning and Computer Vision in connectomics. My current research is in neuropil segmentation algorithms, particularly for EM data using ML tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and share my knowledge, so feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin/via email.
