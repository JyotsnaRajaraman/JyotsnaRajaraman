#### I'm Jyotsna (say:johts-nah), a Computer Science grad student at UChicago.

As of 02/10/2023, I have started 100 days of code and am documenting my journey towards being a better coder and thereby a better Github contributer.

This (https://jyorajaraman.medium.com/building-a-github-account-x-100-days-of-code-day-0-19acdc3097e6) is my article on Medium if you'd like to read about it some more! 

If you are looking for other ways to connect with me, send out a mail or a message on LinkedIn. I am always on the look out for my next conversation and I'm passionate about  Accessibility in Tech and Quantitative Analysis (but even if not, some conversation is better than none!).
