#### I'm Jyotsna (say:johts-nah), a Computer Science graduate student at UIC, with a interest in HPC,ML and connectomics.

I am currently working as a researcher with the EVL Lab, and my area of focus is Machine Learning and High Performance Computing in connectomics. My current research is in neuropil segmentation algorithms, particularly for EM data using ML tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and share my knowledge, so feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin/via email.
